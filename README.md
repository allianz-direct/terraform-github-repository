## Module Features

In contrast to the plain `github_repository` resource this module enables various other
features like Branch Protection or Collaborator Management.

- **Default Security Settings**:
  This module creates a `private` repository by default,
  Deploy keys are `read-only` by default

- **Standard Repository Features**:
  Setting basic Metadata,
  Merge Strategy,
  Auto Init,
  License Template,
  Gitignore Template,
  Template Repository

- **Extended Repository Features**:
  Branch Protection,
  Issue Labels,
  Handle Github Default Issue Labels,
  Collaborators,
  Teams,
  Deploy Keys,
  Projects,
  Repository Webhooks

- _Features not yet implemented_:
  Project Columns support,
  Actions,
  Repository File

## Getting Started

Most basic usage creating a new private github repository.

```hcl
module "repository" {
  source  = "mineiros-io/repository/github"
  version = "~> 0.8.0"

  name               = "terraform-github-repository"
  license_template   = "apache-2.0"
  gitignore_template = "Terraform"
}
```

## Module Argument Reference

See [variables.tf] and [examples/] for details and use-cases.

### Top-level Arguments

#### Module Configuration

- **`module_depends_on`**: _(Optional `list(any)`)_

  Due to the fact, that terraform does not offer `depends_on` on modules as of today (v0.12.24)
  we might hit race conditions when dealing with team names instead of ids.
  So when using the feature of [adding teams by slug/name](#teams-configuration) to the repository when creating it,
  make sure to add all teams to this list as indirect dependencies.
  Default is `[]`.

#### Repository Configuration

- **`name`**: **_(Required `string`)_**

  The name of the repository.

- **[`defaults`](#defaults-object-attributes)**: _(Optional `object`)_

  A object of default settings to use instead of module defaults for top-level arguments.
  See below for a list of supported arguments.
  Default is `{}` - use module defaults as described in the README.

- **`allow_merge_commit`**: _(Optional `bool`)_

  Set to `false` to disable merge commits on the repository.
  If you set this to `false` you have to enable either `allow_squash_merge`
  or `allow_rebase_merge`.
  Default is `true`.

- **`allow_squash_merge`**: _(Optional `bool`)_

  Set to `true` to enable squash merges on the repository.
  Default is `false`.

- **`allow_rebase_merge`**: _(Optional `bool`)_

  Set to `true` to enable rebase merges on the repository.
  Default is `false`.

- **`description`**: _(Optional `string`)_

  A description of the repository.
  Default is `""`.

- **`delete_branch_on_merge`**: _(Optional `string`)_

  Set to `false` to disable the automatic deletion of head branches after pull requests are merged.
  Default is `true`.

- **`homepage_url`**: _(Optional `string`)_

  URL of a page describing the project.

  DEPRICATED. Please use `visibility` instead and update your code. parameter will be removed in a future version

- **`visibility`**: _(Optional `string`)_

  Can be `public` or `private`.
  If your organization is associated with an enterprise account using GitHub Enterprise Cloud or GitHub Enterprise Server 2.20+, `visibility` can also be `internal`.
  The `visibility` parameter overrides the deprecated `private` parameter.
  Default is `private`.
  If the deprecated `private` boolean parameter is used, the default value is adjusted to respect this setting.

- **`has_issues`**: _(Optional `bool`)_

  Set to true to enable the GitHub Issues features on the repository.
  Default is `false`

- **`has_projects`**: _(Optional `bool`)_

  Set to true to enable the GitHub Projects features on the repository.

  Set to `true` to tell GitHub that this is a template repository.
  Default is `false`.

- **`default_branch`**: _(Optional `string`)_

  The name of the default branch of the repository.
  NOTE: This can only be set after a repository has already been created, and
  after a correct reference has been created for the target branch inside the repository.
  This means a user will have to omit this parameter from the initial repository creation and
  create the target branch inside of the repository prior to setting this attribute.
  Default is `""`.

- **`archived`**: _(Optional `bool`)_

  Specifies if the repository should be archived.
  NOTE: Currently, the API does not support unarchiving.

  the list of `topics`. This is useful if `default.topics` are used and the list
  should be extended with more topics.
  Default is `[]`.

#### Repository Creation Configuration

The following four arguments can only be set at repository creation and
changes will be ignored for repository updates and
will not show a diff in plan or apply phase.

- **`auto_init`**: _(Optional `bool`)_

  Set to `false` to not produce an initial commit in the repository.

  See [Template Object Attributes](#template-object-attributes) below for details.

#### Teams Configuration

Your can use non-computed
(known at `terraform plan`) team names or slugs
(`*_teams` Attributes)
or computed (only known in `terraform apply` phase) team IDs
(`*_team_ids` Attributes).
**When using non-computed names/slugs teams need to exist before running plan.**
This is due to some terraform limitation and we will update the module once terraform
removed thislimitation.

- **`pull_teams`** or **`pull_team_ids`**: _(Optional `list(string)`)_

  A list of teams to grant pull (read-only) permission.
  Recommended for non-code contributors who want to view or discuss your project.
  Default is `[]`.

- **`triage_teams`** or **`triage_team_ids`**: _(Optional `list(string)`)_

  A list of teams to grant triage permission.

  A list of teams to grant push (read-write) permission.
  Recommended for contributors who actively push to your project.
  Default is `[]`.

- **`maintain_teams`** or **`maintain_team_ids`**: _(Optional `list(string)`)_

  A list of teams to grant maintain permission.
  Recommended for project managers who need to manage the repository without access
  to sensitive or destructive actions.
  Default is `[]`.

  A list of teams to grant admin (full) permission.
  Recommended for people who need full access to the project, including sensitive
  and destructive actions like managing security or deleting a repository.
  Default is `[]`.

#### Collaborator Configuration

- **`pull_collaborators`**: _(Optional `list(string)`)_

  A list of user names to add as collaborators granting them pull (read-only) permission.
  Recommended for non-code contributors who want to view or discuss your project.
  Default is `[]`.

- **`triage_collaborators`**: _(Optional `list(string)`)_

  A list of user names to add as collaborators granting them triage permission.
  Recommended for contributors who need to proactively manage issues and pull requests
  without write access.
  Default is `[]`.

- **`push_collaborators`**: _(Optional `list(string)`)_

  A list of user names to add as collaborators granting them push (read-write) permission.
  Recommended for contributors who actively push to your project.
  Default is `[]`.

- **`maintain_collaborators`**: _(Optional `list(string)`)_

  A list of user names to add as collaborators granting them maintain permission.
  Recommended for project managers who need to manage the repository without access
  to sensitive or destructive actions.
  Default is `[]`.

- **`admin_collaborators`**: _(Optional `list(string)`)_

  A list of user names to add as collaborators granting them admin (full) permission.
  Recommended for people who need full access to the project, including sensitive
  and destructive actions like managing security or deleting a repository.
  Default is `[]`.

#### Deploy Keys Configuration

- **[`deploy_keys`](#deploy_key-object-attributes)**: _(Optional `list(deploy_key|string)`)_

  Specifies deploy keys and access-level of deploy keys used in this repository.
  Every `string` in the list will be converted internally into the `object`
  representation with the `key` argument being set to the `string`.
  `object` details are explained below.
  Default is `[]`.

- **[`deploy_keys_computed`](#deploy_key-object-attributes)**: _(Optional `list(deploy_key|string)`)_

  Same as `deploy_keys` argument with the following differences:
  Use this argument if you depend on computed keys that terraform can not use in
  resource `for_each` execution. Downside of this is the recreation of deploy key
  resources whenever the order in the list changes. **Prefer `deploy_keys` whenever possible.**
  This argument does **not** conflict with `deploy_keys` and should exclusively be
  used for computed resources.
  Default is `[]`.

#### Branch Protections Configuration

- **[`branch_protections`](#branch_protection-object-attributes)**: _(Optional `list(branch_protection)`)_

  This resource allows you to configure branch protection for repositories in your organization.
  When applied, the branch will be protected from forced pushes and deletion.
  Additional constraints, such as required status checks or restrictions on users and teams,
  can also be configured.
  Default is `[]`.

#### Issue Labels Configuration

- **[`issue_labels`](#issue_label-object-attributes)**: _(Optional `list(issue_label)`)_

  This resource allows you to create and manage issue labels within your GitHub organization.
  Issue labels are keyed off of their "name", so pre-existing issue labels result
  in a 422 HTTP error if they exist outside of Terraform.
  Normally this would not be an issue, except new repositories are created with a
  "default" set of labels, and those labels easily conflict with custom ones.
  This resource will first check if the label exists, and then issue an update,
  otherwise it will create.
  Default is `[]`.

- **[`issue_labels_merge_with_github_labels`](#issue_label-object-attributes)**: _(Optional `bool`)_

  Specify if github default labels will be handled by terraform. This should be decided on upon creation of the repository. If you later decide to disable this feature, github default labels will be destroyed if not
  replaced by labels set in `issue_labels` argument.
  Default is `true`.

- **[`issue_labels_create`](#issue_label-object-attributes)**: _(Optional `bool`)_

  Specify whether you want to force or suppress the creation of issues labels.
  Default is `true` if `has_issues` is `true` or `issue_labels` is non-empty, otherwise default is `false`.

#### Projects Configuration

- **[`projects`](#project-object-attributes)**: _(Optional `list(project)`)_

  This resource allows you to create and manage projects for GitHub repository.
  Default is `[]`.

#### Webhooks Configuration

- **[`webhooks`](#webhook-object-attributes)**: _(Optional `list(webhook)`)_

  This resource allows you to create and manage webhooks for repositories in your organization.
  When applied, a webhook will be created which specifies a URL to receive events and which events
  to receieve. Additional constraints, such as SSL verification, pre-shared secret and content type
  can also be configured
  Default is `[]`.

#### Secrets Configuration

- **`plaintext_secrets`**: _(Optional `map(string)`)_

  This map allows you to create and manage secrets for repositories in your organization.
  Each element in the map is considered a secret to be managed, being the key map the secret name and the value the corresponding secret in plain text:
  ```
  plaintext_secrets = {
    SECRET_NAME_1 = "secret_value_1"
    SECRET_NAME_2 = "secret_value_2"
    ...
  }
  ```
  When applied, a secret with the given key and value will be created in the repositories.
  The value of the secrets must be given in plain text, github provider is in charge of encrypting it.
  **Attention:** You might want to get secrets via a data source from a secure vault and not add them in plain text to your source files; so you do not commit plaintext secrets into the git repository managing your github account.
  Default is `{}`.

## Module Versioning

This Module follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)].

Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, we increment the:

1. `MAJOR` version when we make incompatible changes,
2. `MINOR` version when we add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
3. `PATCH` version when we make backwards compatible bug fixes.

### Backwards compatibility in `0.0.z` and `0.y.z` version

- Backwards compatibility in versions `0.0.z` is **not guaranteed** when `z` is increased. (Initial development)
- Backwards compatibility in versions `0.y.z` is **not guaranteed** when `y` is increased. (Pre-release)
